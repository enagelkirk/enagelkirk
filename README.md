👋 Hey, I’m Ethan — a data scientist and certified AWS Cloud Practitioner who enjoys turning complex data into tools and insights that people can actually use.

🎓 I recently completed my Master’s in Data Science, where I focused on building practical projects that combine machine learning, data visualization, and real-world problem solving. I’ve worked with tools like Tableau, Python, and SQL to deliver clear, actionable outcomes.

☁️ I earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to strengthen my understanding of cloud infrastructure, scalability, and secure deployments. I'm especially interested in developing lightweight, cloud-based apps and dashboards.

🌐 I also run [cloudandquery.com](https://cloudandquery.com), where I share my experience working through data projects and building in the cloud.

🔧 Tools I work with regularly:
- Python, SQL, R, Tableau
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
- AWS (S3, IAM, EC2, Amplify)
- Git & GitHub (of course)

🚀 Always learning. Always building.
